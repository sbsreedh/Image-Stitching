##  Homographic Transformation and Image Stitching:

Image stitching is mainly used to combine multiple images with different angle perspective. Here the images with matching points are overlapped to produce a high-resolution image of a segmented panorama. Here in this assignment we are given three images of a lunchroom which are taken with three different angles. All these images are stitched together finding the strong key points.
